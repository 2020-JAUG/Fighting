 Third GeeksHubs Challenge!
</h1>

## About
- With this challenge, we put into practice what we have learned about Object-Oriented Programming.
- Using HTML CSS and JavaScript.


## Usage
- You can play directly by clicking this link <a href="https://2020-jaug.github.io/Fighting/">GitHub Pages deployment</a>.
- The game is one against one, only one fight, only one winner, you will give everything to win...
- On the first screen you have a 10 second intro, if you don't want to see it you can press start.
- Next you access the second screen in which you must choose two players.
- Then you have the screen where the fighters are presented, to continue press start.
- Wait for the comments to end and the fight begins.
